- 👋 Hi, I’m Julius! The name Distr0hopper was created because I couldn't decide on a Linux distro for a long time and tried a few, but now I just stick with ubuntu.
- 👀 I’m interested in many types of programming, but would like to expand my skills in web development/app development. I am also interested in robotics and embedded systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Human-Computer-Interaction and writing my bachelorsthesis at the Chair of Robotics in Würzburg. The repository containing the bachelorsthesis code can be seen at @Rover-GUI. Im starting my master in Computer Science in the Summer 2024.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend programming with JDBC and MySQL.
