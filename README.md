- 👋 Hi, I’m Julius! The name Distr0hopper was created because I couldn't decide on a Linux distro for a long time and tried a few, but now I just stick with ubuntu.
- 👀 I’m interested in many types of programming, but would like to expand my skills in web development/app development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Science in the Master at the University of Würzburg (Bavaria). 

<!---
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend programming with JDBC and MySQL.
Distr0hopper/Distr0hopper is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
